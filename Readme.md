# How to use DateTimeNavigation service


<p>This example shows how to implement forward/back navigation to navigate a "displayed" time frame (month, day, week, etc.) at a time. It uses the <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraSchedulerServicesIDateTimeNavigationServicetopic">IDateTimeNavigationService</a> which provides two methods - <strong>NavigateForward</strong>, which advances forward in time as suggested by the current view, and <strong>NavigateBackward</strong>, which steps back in time. </p>
<p>You can also use the SchedulerControl.Services.DateTimeNavigation.NavigateBackward() and SchedulerControl.Services.DateTimeNavigation.NavigateForward() notation to call the service methods.</p>
